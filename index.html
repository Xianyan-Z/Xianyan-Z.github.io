  I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Metal Forming group in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering <a href = "https://www.ntnu.edu/mtp/department-of-mechanical-and-industrial-engineering">Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</a> at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 
  I focuse on developing novel metal forming techniques to produce complex parts with high performance and low cost aiming to solve critical industry problems in automotive, aerospace, etc. I has gained rich knowledge in solid mechanics, computational mechanics and physic-based plasticity and damage model development. Currently, she is engaged in developing an innovative mechanical calibration method to correct the dimensional deviation in thin-walled components such as the aluminium battery trays in electric cars. 
  I work with 
    <a href = "https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/torgeir.welo">Torgeir Welo</a>, 
    <a href = "https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/jun.ma">Jun Ma</a>, and 
    <a href = "https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/sigmund.tronvoll">Sigmund Arnts√∏nn Tronvoll</a>. 
<br/>
Before I came to NTNU, I studied my PhD at Imperial College London on central cracking mechanisms and criterion in cross wedge rolling, supervised by
    <a href = "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jun.jiang">Jun Jiang</a>, and 
    <a href = "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jianguo.lin">Jianguo Lin</a>.
Before my PhD, I visited the University of Nottingham in 2016, and worked with
    <a href = "https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/people/h.ou">Hengan Ou</a> on surface grinding technology. 
I studied at the School of Automotive Engineering at the Wuhan University of Technology from 2009 to 2016 for Bachelor and master's degrees. I worked on a retired car recycling project and investigated the retired car body shredding mechanisms. I was supervised by
